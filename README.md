### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt, and I currently work for the BYU Basketball team helping with data analytics, film study, and strategy. I often work on projects creating predictive models and generating reports for the coaching staff. I have a bachelor's degree in statistics, emphasizing in data science. Through my schooling I've gained skills in R programming, Python, SQL, data visualization, predictive models, and machine learning. I am passionate about sports and statistics, and I'm always striving to improve my data science and analytics capabilities. 

On this page I've included a few of the basketball projects I've worked on, as well as other work, to demonstrate my abilities in coding and analytics. I hope you enjoy exploring my projects! Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or feedback about my projects. Thanks!
